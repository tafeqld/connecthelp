      <description>A grade book contains your grading system, grade calculations, grade scheme, grade items, and view and display options. Grade items in your grade book represent all the work that you want to evaluate users on in a unit. You can evaluate specific tasks such as assignments, tests, and participation, and you can also create grade items and associate them with unit objects such as Dropbox and Quizzes.
You must set up a grade book before you can use the Grades tool.</description>

      <description>As an educator, can configure your grade book settings in Connect. You can select how grades display to students, how they update in the grade book, and how you want to deal with ungraded items. You can create grade items for projects, assignments, discussions, quizzes, etc. to include in your grade book, and even associate them with other tools (e.g. Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions).
Typically, units in Connect are created with the grade book settings, grade items, and associations already configured by an assembler or learning designer.</description>
