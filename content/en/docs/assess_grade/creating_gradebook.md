 As an educator, can configure your grade book settings in Connect. You can select how grades display to students, how they update in the grade book, and how you want to deal with ungraded items. You can create grade items for projects, assignments, discussions, quizzes, etc. to include in your grade book, and even associate them with other tools (e.g. Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions).

Typically, units in Connect are created with the grade book settings, grade items, and associations already configured by an assembler or learning designer.
