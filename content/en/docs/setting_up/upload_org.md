## Setting up

The Manage Files tool is a file management system for your unit. You can use this tool to organise and upload files associated with your unit offering. We recommend that you organise your files into folders, creating a folder for each unit, module, or topic of content as appropriate.

Manage Files enables you to select and upload files from your computer to Connect. You can upload most file types to a content directory in Manage Files, but only files with specific extensions can be used as content topics.

The functions you can perform in Manage Files can be divided into the following two categories:

- Organise and manage unit files and folders - Perform tasks such as creating, editing, deleting, uploading, moving files and folder, and zipping and unzipping files.
- Create topics from your files - You can create topics using files from your unit content structure.

Note: When you unzip a file on the Manage Files page in a unit, a message notifies you that the operation is happening in the background and that you will be notified when it is complete. This allows you to perform other tasks while waiting for the operation to complete.

When the file successfully unzips, a notification appears in the minibar. Clicking the notification takes you back to the Manage Files page in the unit.
